# ESP8266_WiFi_Webserver
This sketch was created as a template for generating a local ESP8266 web server. The default webpage will load a single ON/OFF button. Update the Wi-Fi parameters before uploading sketch in order to access the webpage. Then, add your I/O pins and adjust HTTP code in the Client.ino tab according to your specific project.
